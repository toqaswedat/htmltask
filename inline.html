    <h1>Page-level & inline CSS Styling</h1>
    <p style="color: orange;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
         and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
         text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
         scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
         leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
          of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
           including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most distinctive features of their fonts. It is used because the letters involved and the letter spacing in those combinations reveal, at their best, the weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.</p>
